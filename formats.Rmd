File formats are a unified way which softwares would know how to open and evaluate
the content. 

## Tabular formats

### Export data into easy to read formats

* Ideally - Save data in plain text files.  
eg in Excel (one sheet per file): 
  File -> Save As -> File Format: 
  
Comma-separated Values (.csv)
```
chr,position,orientation
chr1,89009884,+
chrX,14400933,-
```
<br>

Tab-delimited Text (.txt)
```
date    patientID   proviral_load
2023-07-01    M100544   100
2023-10-01    F123455   40

```
<br>
  

* R has packages for reading excel files (recommended only if has to be multi-sheet).

## Non-tabular formats

### General formats

Will not be covered here, but you may come across them - e.g. XML, JSON, TOML - often 
have dedicated packages for reading into R. 

### Biological formats

Will not be covered here, but you may come across them - e.g. VCF, SAM, FASTA - often 
have dedicated packages for reading into R - search https://www.bioconductor.org
