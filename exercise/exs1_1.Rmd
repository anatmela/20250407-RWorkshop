# Improving Messy Data (Tidy Data) 

A lot of real data isn't very tidy, mostly because most scientists aren't taught
about how to structure their data in a way that is easy to analyze.

[Download an untidy version](https://datacarpentry.github.io/semester-biology/data/untidy-portal-data.xlsx) of some of the Portal Project data, which includes information on the data, species identification, weight and sampling plot for some small mammals. 

Discuss: 

1. What problems do you see with this file?
2. How would you improve this data?
